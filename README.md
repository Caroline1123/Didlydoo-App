# The Assignment
You have been hired by a "truly disruptive" startup, to create a revolutionnary tool to plan events with friends and relatives. Introducing Didlydoo, the event planner!

A backend developer has already created an API for the tool, so you can focus on the frontend. The list of endpoints is available below.

Your tasks is to :

ðŸŒ± Display all the events, including everyone's availability
ðŸŒ± Allow users to create events
ðŸŒ± Allow users to add their availability to an existing event
ðŸŒ± Edit an event name/description/author
ðŸŒ± Delete an event
ðŸŒ± You must validate your inputs before sending the data to your backend, inputs required must be filed and shorter than 256 characters. If it's not the case you don't send the request and display the appropriate error below the input.
Bonus :

ðŸŒ¼ Display the best possible date for the event according to everyone availabilities
Constrains:

``` No js libraries, or frameworks```

This is the mockup that the company founder has drawn on a piece of paper during a lunch break (you can use it, or create your own layout).

Backend setup
Clone the backend directory on your computer and open in it in a terminal, then type npm install once to install the dependencies.

To launch the server simply type node server/index.mjs to start the server (the terminal has to remain open and running).
